## Under the Table

Under the Table is a simple website where you can create, comment, edit, and read your's and other's favorite board games!

## Getting Started

To download and play, simple visit https://under-the-table.herokuapp.com/

## What's Next?

I'm not sure what the future of this project is. It's difficult to decide the point of the site, while maintaining simplicity and relevancy throug time.

This site will intentionally not have user authentication, because the scope of this project is so small that I want a simple goal to be showcased without any inhibitors to viewing.

If any changes to this goal arise, I will update here and make a repo notification!
