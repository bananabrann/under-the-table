Under the Table has gone thorugh two major reworks,
and unfortunately the original planning file has been 
removed. As such to fullfill the GA requirements,
this planning page has been split into two parts:
1) Early Days and 2) Later Days. A lot of the pictures
have been lost too, as they were contained in the 
original file without me know they were in there when
I reworked them.

---THE EARLY DAYS---
