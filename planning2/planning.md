Under the Table has gone through two major reworks, and unfortunately the orignal planning materials were lost on transfering repos during a PUG to HBS reformatting. As such, the following is written in past-tense.

The files were orginally planned out by the folder structure. I wrote down the folder structure, and what the purpose of these folders would be and what they would house.

From there, I typed out my models and what properties I wanted them to contain. 

I moved forward by building out the routes and models, testing database, and then finally adding the controllers. Half the project time was devoted to controller debugging, and had only short-term planning during debug.
